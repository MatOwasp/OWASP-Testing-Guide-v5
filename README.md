# OWASP-Testing-Guide-v5

# Roadmap for v5.

## What

The OWASP Testing Guide v4 includes a “best practice” penetration testing framework which users can implement in their own organisations. The Testing Guide v4 also includes a “low level” penetration testing guide that describes techniques for testing the most common web application and web service security issues. Today the Testing Guide is the standard to perform Web Application Penetration Testing, and many companies around the world have adopted it. It is vital to maintain an updated project that represents the state of the art for WebAppSec.

The aim of the Working Session is to discuss and define the scope and content of OWASP Testing Guide v5.
Outcomes

    All sections in v4 reviewed
    Project aligned with the ASVS and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
    A more readable guide created that eliminates sections that are not useful
    New testing techniques inserted
    Some sections rationalised as Session Management Testing
    New section created: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing
